Council tax is your way of helping to pay for many local services like emergency services, rubbish collection, libraries, schools, street lights and much more.

Council tax is charged on the household. It's based on the value of the property and not on what the household earns.

The amount of council tax you have to pay depends on which property band your home is in.

Your final bill will be changed if you qualify for any of the*[council tax discounts or exemptions.](https://www.bristol.gov.uk/c/portal/layout?p_l_id=20888)*
