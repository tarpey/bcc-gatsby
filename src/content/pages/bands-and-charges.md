Each property in Bristol is in one of these council tax bands:

| Band | Property value              | Council tax |
| ---- | --------------------------- | ----------- |
| A    | Up to and including £40,000 | £1,374.01   |
| B    | £40,001 - £52,000           | £1,603.04   |
| C    | £52,001 - £68,000           | £1,832.02   |

In England, these bands are based on their value on 1 April 1991.

## Appeal if you think your council tax band is wrong

Contact the [Valuation Office Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/valuation-office-agency) to appeal or for advice.

You can only appeal against the banding of your property:

- after the property has been demolished
- if a house has been converted into flats
- if there are physical changes in the area that change the value of the property
- if the Valuation Officer changes what band your property is in
- within six months of becoming the person who pays the council tax
- the Court making a band change to a property that is similar to yours
- if you’ve made alterations to the property which changes the value
- starting or stopping to use part of your property for business reasons

If you appeal, you must continue to [pay council tax](/c/portal/layout?p_l_id=20782) until your appeal is decided.
